# active_hunch
# this code contains the numerical model using FELA for earth pressure calculation of retaining walls
# MATLAB 2024b is suggested
# model calculates Ka, Pa, z/h and thetaR
# mesh for FELA calculations should be developed in another platform like ABAQUS and mesh files should be saved as .inp
# the MATLAB code starts by importing the mesh
For trial: Use the .inp file attached. It contains mesh for hunch wall with h=6m, theta=10deg, h1/h2=1
