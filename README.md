# this code contains the numerical model using FELA for earth pressure calculation of retaining walls
# MATLAB 2024b is suggested
# model calculates Ka, Pa, z/h and thetaR
# mesh for FELA calculations should be developed in another platform like ABAQUS and mesh files should be saved as .inp
# the MATLAB code starts by importing the mesh
